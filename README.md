# Hi, I'm JoÃ£o Saraiva ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate full-stack developer nestled in the beautiful Portuguese countryside, where I blend the tranquility of nature with the dynamic world of software development. I thrive on building high-quality, user-centric digital experiences.

My core focus lies in creating engaging and performant front-end applications, but my full-stack background allows me to understand and contribute to the entire development lifecycle.
