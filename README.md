# Hi there, my name is JoÃ£o Saraiva ðŸ‘‹

## Description

I'm a full-stack developer living in the beautiful countryside of Portugal.

Iâ€™m currently working at Diconium (Lisbon, Portugal), as a frontend developer.
Iâ€™m dedicated and not afraid of new challenges. I thrive to become a better professional and working with experienced team members gives me lots of joy. 
In my opinion, a team must have a common goal, share constructive feedback and evolve.
With almost 5 years of experience, I had the opportunity to work with a vast number of technologies, which made me more responsible and capable of delivering good quality software.
Beyond my job, I regularly use some of my free time to develop my skills, either by working on small projects or reading documentation.
Iâ€™m passionate about life.

The things I love the most are: 

    traveling, admiring landscapes and trying different kinds of food
    learning new languages
    listening to music
    do all kinds of sports
    gardening / bricolage
    spending time with my family and friends.

I love productive and cultural conversations. 
When I have the opportunity, I attend cultural events like music concerts, go to museums or visit exhibitions.

Here are the tools I use the most:
    
    React , Vue, Angular
    NodeJS
    Typescript
    Three JS
    SCSS
    Tailwind CSS
    Redux
    Adobe Experience Manager
    Java
    Python
    GraphQL
    Azure DevOps
    Kubernetes
    Docker

Other skills that might be of interest:

    Semantic and accessible HTML
    Progressive Web Applications
    Responsiveness
    SEO, performance on the web
    DevOps
    State management (Redux)
    Web components
    UI Design (Figma)
    3D modeling (Blender)


My native language is Portuguese.
I can also speak fluent English, French and Spanish.
Iâ€™m currently learning German and Iâ€™m already capable of having a normal conversation.
