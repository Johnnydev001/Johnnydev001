# HiðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate full-stack developer nestled in the beautiful Portuguese countryside, where I blend the tranquility of nature with the dynamic world of software development. I thrive on building high-quality, user-centric digital experiences.

This experience has instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility and a commitment to quality craftsmanship.

My core focus lies in creating engaging and performant front-end applications, but my full-stack background allows me to understand and contribute to the entire development lifecycle. I'm always looking for new challenges and enjoy collaborating with experienced teams, believing that shared goals and constructive feedback are the foundation of collective growth.
