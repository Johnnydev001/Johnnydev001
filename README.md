# Hi there, I'm JoÃ£o Saraiva ðŸ‘‹

##  Description

I'm a full-stack developer living in the beautiful countryside of Portugal.

Iâ€™m currently working at Diconium (Lisbon, Portugal), as a frontend developer.
With almost 5 years of experience, I had the opportunity to work with a vast number of technologies, which made me more responsible and capable of delivering good quality software.

Iâ€™m dedicated and not afraid of new challenges. I thrive to become a better professional and working with experienced team members gives me lots of joy. 
In my opinion, a team must have a common goal, share constructive feedback and evolve.

Beyond my job, I regularly use some of my free time to develop my skills, either by working on small projects or reading documentation.
Iâ€™m passionate about life.
